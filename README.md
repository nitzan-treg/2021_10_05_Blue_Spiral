#  Blue Spiral
This render is an attempt to recreate the beautiful art of Toros Kose https://www.behance.net/gallery/53909071/HPE-Everything-Computes
my approach was to create multiple curves by copying a line to a curve. looking back at it, I it would have been easier with a "sweep" node.
Rendered the geometry as curves using Redshift
